# HexxyCraft CraftTweaker Scripts

These [CraftTweaker](https://modrinth.com/mod/crafttweaker) scripts were originally made for the HexxyCraft server. They've been rehosted here for convenience but you can find them in their original home [here](https://github.com/HexxyCraft/modpack/tree/13ff7938c02066e30644153c03eb80011247cfb6/scripts).

## Merge Phial

_uses `merge_phials.zs` and `phials.zs`_

Adds recipes for merging phials above max capacity. Merging requires two full phials and returns an empty phial with their combined capacity.

If the resulting phial would be over 200k it instead returns two full phials with the average capacity.

## Turtle Phial

_uses `turtle_phial.zs`_

Disables the default computercraft turtle recipes and replaces them with ones requiring phials. 

## Seal Fix

_uses `shibva_seal_fix.zs`_

This one comes from shibva, not hexxycraft. Adds/fixes focus and spellbook sealing recipes for forge 1.19.2. Does not show up properly in EMI.
